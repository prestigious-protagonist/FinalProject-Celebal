In this project I've implemented microservices. Each service has been deployed independently on render(deploying platform).

Role Based Access Control: Managed by Auth0 </br>
Application could be slow as it is deployed under the free tier plan. <br/>
Each request after a specific time of inactivity leads to the cold start of the complete service. <br/>
So for the first time features might take 15-20 seconds to load. <br/>
Some routes are yet to be implemented, this frontend is the minimal representation of the product. </br>
The MVP of this backend project can be viewed on <i>https://upes.vercel.app</i>
